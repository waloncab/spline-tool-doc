                <h2>Create</h2>

                <p>
                In order to create a new Spline -> go to the unity toolbar -> S-Lines/Spline.
                A new game object will be created with their correspondent scripts.
                </p>

                <h2>Spline Frame</h2>

                <p>
                This is the main component for editing and extending the spline. In order to edit the spline click on its 
                correspondent nodes and drag them wherever you need them to be, this way you can create any path you want.
                To make it easier for editing, the only way to add new nodes, is to duplicate the selected one, click the 
                button inside its editor (each node is a different gameObject).
                </p>

                <img src="img/spline_frame_base.png" alt="Spline Base" class="center">

                <h3>Architecture</h3>

                <p>
                    It is interesting to know that each nod is contained in a different gameObject. 
                    They are connected in a linked list structure for fast iteration and easy CRUD {Create, Read, Update, Delete} operations.
                    This spline architecture allows to create simple script extensions. 
                    For example a single node could be moved at runtime in a wavy oscilation movement 
                    (a script is needed to achive this behaviour).
                </p>

                <h3>Editing</h3>

                <p>
                On the scene view the spline is renderer with a thin curve line and the nodes are represented as white dots.
                You can select the nodes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>directly in the spline</li>
                    <li>in the spline_frame inspector</li>
                    <li>by opening the gameObject that contains the node</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Use the regular unity transform tool to drag the nodes anywhere you need them.</p>

                <h3>Toolbar</h3>

                <p>
                    The Toolbar at the top of the component includes some of the basic editing options. 
                </p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Button</th>
                        <th>Action</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><</td>
                        <td>Select the first node</td>

                        <td>R</td>

                    </tr>
                </table>
                
                <h3>Closed</h3>

                <p>
                The spline can be either oper or closed. Many times closed path are needed, and when this is the case,
                the rest of the componnets that depend directly on the spline shape will be notified in their beahviour.
                </p>

                <h3>Node List</h3>

                <p>
                The inspector allows the view of all of the child nodes that conform the spline.
                Any of them can be selected from here and the current GameObject selection will be modified.
                </p>

                <h3>Events</h3>

                <p>
                There are a few interesitng events we might want to interact with such as when the shape of the spline is changed.
                The tool supports the unity event property and allows a easy integration with the user scripts. 
                </p>

                <h3>Extensions</h3>

                <p>
                Within the Spline_Frame component you can create new beahviour for the line, such as drawers or traversals.
                In order to add a new extension component select the one you need on the "extend" view in the inspector.
                </p>

            <h2>Traverse</h2>

            <p>
            The Travesal component contains the iteration in the spline. 
            Use it to move a gameObject along the curve, but to do it in game mode (automatically) you need to extend it with a Walker.
            </p>

            <h3>Distance</h3>

            <p>The distance {parameter that describes the iteration state} represents the acumalated distance
            from the start of the spline.</p>

            <h3>Update</h3>

            <p>
            It is important to understant that the current position and rotation are calculated based on the current distance.
            Since the distance is the main variable representing the iteration state, 
            to calculate or not the according postion and rotation is decision of the user.
            This way the traversal can be optimized precisaly.
            </p>

            <h3>Handler</h3>

            <p>
            There are a few buttons on the inspector to make a conmfortable user experience, 
            either modifying the distance or using these buttons the traversal state will be changed.

                There are a few interesitng events we might want to interact with.

            Walker makes the Travesal work in game mode, and Handles. Moves the Traversal component based on a few pareameters.
            Use it whenever a GameObject needs to follow the spline path, the Traversal by itself just represents the iteration state.

                <h2>Mesh</h2>

                <p>This component must be extended throw a spline_frame.</p>

                <p>
                There are some ways of rendering a mesh along the spline. It is one of the most interesting features of the tool.
                But also the one that takes more resources, use when need it considering the optimization of the game.
                </p>

                <h3>Line Mesh</h3>

                <p>
                The line mesh component allows you to chose some shapes to render. 
                The following sections explain each of its parameters.
                </p>

                <h4>Segment Length</h4>

                <p>  
                This parameter is critical for the final mesh. Depending on the segment distance the mesh will be lighter or heavier.
                Low poly style scenes might be content with a bigger segment distance than more accurate mesh scenes.
                </p>

                <h4>Auto</h4>

                <p>  
                The mesh is by default updated whenever the spline is changed. Sometimes this behaviour is not what you might want
                since the spline is very large and the mesh can take a little longer to keep up to the spline shape.
                However all mesh operations are executed in parallel (multithreaded)
                </p>

                <h4>Extend</h4>

                <p>
                The way you select a concrete shape is by extending the Line Mesh component. Once selected click on "Extend",
                another script is added with concrete parameters for the selected mesh.
                </p>

                    <li><a href="#shape_box">Box</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#shape_custom">Custom</a></li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Optimization</h4>

                <p>
                As it is mentioned before, the mesh rendering part of tool is design to run in parallel.
                This parallel design allows you to edit the mesh in the unity editor without lag.
                However if the spline is very large you may want to separete the spline editing from the mesh rendering process.
                If this is the case simply uncheck the "auto" toggle and update the mesh when need it.
                </p>
