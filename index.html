            <p>
            In order to create a new Spline -> go to the unity toolbar -> S-Lines/Spline.
            A new game object will be created with their correspondent scripts.

        <h2>SPLINE FRAME</h2>

        <p>
        This is the main component for editing and extending the spline. In order to edit the spline click on its 
        correspondent nodes and drag them wherever you need them to be, this way you can create any path you want.
        To make it easier for editing, the only way to add new nodes, is to duplicate the selected one, click the 
        button inside its editor (each node is a different gameObject).
        </p>

                -> by opening the gameObject that contains the node
            <li>Use the editor to create the spline path that you want</li>
            <li>Use the inspector to change the node mode </li>
                -> {Free, Aligned, Mirrored, Auto, Poly}
            <li>Use the {Duplicate} button to duplicate the current node</li>
                -> its the only way of extending the spline
                -> 
            <li>Use the {Remove} button to remove the current node </li>
                -> dont delete the gameObject directly: it can cause problems;

        <h2>EXTENSIONS</h2>

        <p>
        Within the Spline_Frame component you can create new beahviour for the line, such as drawers or traversals.
        In order to add a new extension component select the one you need in the "extend" view in the inspector.
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Extension</th>
                <th>Beahviour</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Traverse</td>
                <td>...</td>

        </table> 


        <h2>DRAW</h2>

        <p>
        Draws a trail render along the line. You can modfiy any of the values the trail render includes
        and they will be visible when the game starts. This component get updated automatically if you modfiy
        the line during update mode.
        </p>

        <h2>TRAVERSE</h2>

        <p>
        The Travesal component contains the iteration in the spline. Use it to move
        a gameObject along the curve, but to do it in game mode (automatically) you need to extend it with a Walker.
        The distance {parameter that describes the iteration state} represents the acumalated distance
        from the start of the spline.
        </p>

        <p>
        Walker makes the Travesal work in game mode, and Handles.
        </p>

            <li>Specify the direction that you want</li>
                -> Forward
                -> Backward
            <li> Use the following modes for different movement</li>
                -> Loop
                -> Ping-Pong
                -> Stop
        </ul>
